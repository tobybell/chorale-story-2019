<h2>June 17&#8211;30</h2>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>It was a blisteringly hot day in the Wild West, where the sun melted off the barbed trees and cattle were reduced to big brown lumps of mud dotting the orange landscape. From this still scene of stupor emerged a raggedy band, clothed in all black and black ribbons streaming out behind the formidable entourage.</p>

<p>Now this group may have seemed all grand and mighty at first glance, but truthfully they were suffering from a tragic water shortage. They had long run out of Toby&#8217;s endless supply of snickers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cows! I see cows!&#8221; A cry emerged from the group&#8217;s president Minseung. The members behind him gave a most harmonious and glorious whoop, for the sight of cows = water source = water nearby!</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I hope we&#8217;ll find a veritable rolling river!&#8221; Courtney cried from the back. &#8220;The powers have delivered us from this fiery furnace. Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, the group gathered what little energy they had left and gladly raced ahead (although one member winced at the terrible puns her pen had brought to life). Gradually, packed dirt gave way to cacti, which gave way to shrubbery and small plants and even a dove that burst into the sky as the raucous group approached.</p>

<p>Ah, a stream! The 20-odd members bent their thirsty bodies toward the water, just as the sun set and cast ropes of glowing orange throughout the sky above. Having sated their thirst at last, the Stanford Chamber Chorale was ready to tackle a new day.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>One by one, the singers appeared at breakfast in the Royal Cambridge Hotel. Steve arrived first, as usual, with his brow still furrowed after last night&#8217;s disastrous Evensong. He was so upset that he posted his daily deluge of Facebook photos an entire 20 minutes later than he usually did&#8212;and, in particular, refused to tag Eric Lebel for his brazen &#8220;Ay-men.&#8221; With a stern expression, he reminded Eric that when you&#8217;re late by a minute, you waste one minute for 23 other people and therefore waste 23 minutes, but when you&#8217;re early with a vowel like that, the rest of the singers might as well not show up to Evensong at all. Indeed, Jasmine, Theo, and Frances had the foresight to sit this one out&#8212;as did who would have been our entire audience.</p>

<p>(Ah yes, didn&#8217;t you know? Jasmine can see the future. She actually sings so high that the frequency of her voice aligns with the electromagnetic waves of time, the fourth dimension, which allows her to travel through it. That&#8217;s why she has the body of a child but the personality of an 80-year-old. In fact, she often mutters her visions under her breath but speaks so softly that people almost never hear her.)</p>

<p>It just so happened that Theo always keeps his ears wide open listening for the juiciest gossip, so when he heard Jasmine&#8217;s prophecy that Evensong would be a catastrophe, he declared, &#8220;Fuck this shit,&#8221; with an eye roll and headed into town so he could day-drink and judge the hordes of Jersey Shore-looking characters who would flock to every bar in the city. Frances, on the other hand, did not hear Jasmine&#8217;s warning&#8212;she missed Evensong for an even more outrageous reason: she organized a dress-up party for the boy choristers of St. John&#8217;s so they could pretend they were Americans. That&#8217;s why our clothes and belongings were dispersed as they were. Anyway, back to breakfast.</p>

<p>Oscar arrived with flowers for Julia, but stealthily abandoned them when Steve met his eyes with a steely gaze that reads, &#8220;NO HOOKUPS ALLOWED.&#8221; Sonja strode in, still glowing from her run, as her armpit hairs flowed majestically in the wind. She picked up Oscar&#8217;s flowers and tried in vain to locate the nearest compost bin. Even though she made no effort to ask Kyle where it could be, Kyle enthusiastically volunteered an explanation of why such waste bins are scarcer in Europe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s really interesting,&#8221; said Sonja, the only person who could offer such a response without any sarcasm whatsoever. &#8220;Tell me more!&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>&#8220;More cowbell!&#8221; shouted DJ Rrrr-ochat as he crowdsured to the pulsating rhythms of his most famous mixtape: Monteverdi Euro-beats Off Gershwin.</p>

<p>&#8220;They only like you because they think you&#8217;re British,&#8221; scowled Anna, who had grown tired of being fanned over by pouty Americans in her world-weary three years at Stanford.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am British!&#8221; yelled DJ Rrrr-ochat, as he crowdsured past Millie, who had decided that the crowd looked like a good place to nap and was lying down looking at her phone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does anyone know why Joss&#8217;s DJ name is DJ Rrrr-ochat?&#8221; asked Alexis Rochat as he seductively squinted across the crowd looking for someone to tell him whether the drop had gone a touch flat.</p>

<p>Never ones to miss an opportunity to respond to a potentially rhetorical question, Toby and Alexis Ivec FaceTimed Cooper to confer. Courtney took this chance to remind everyone that Alexis Rochat&#8217;s actual college DJ name was <em>Sexi Lexi</em>, while Teresa convened a focus group to discuss whether the music performed by DJ Rrrr-ochat could be improved or should instead, perhaps, be halted altogether. While no decision was reached, it was discovered that should Miles ever choose to become a DJ, his name should be <em>Mile</em>, because he is singular. It was also discovered that this approach would not work well for James.</p>

<p>Over at the bar Lauren dazzled her fellow patrons with incredible feats of magic, while Ben, who seems like someone who would be good at card tricks but actually isn&#8217;t, smiled broadly at no one in particular. Meanwhile, a wrinkled old crone, Amy, frantically tried to locate the glass of tonic water she had dropped her dentures in before Millie sampled it. Suddenly, a pale green mist rose from the ground; summoned by Lauren&#8217;s feats of wizardry, a strange creature emerged on the dance floor with a shudder&#8230; &#8220;It is I, the KUSNADI!&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>To the absolute techno/house banger, &#8220;Unending Love,&#8221; the chorale danced with the Kusnadis in the classy Whetherspoon&#8217;s establishment. Oscar danced with particular grace as Julia gazed with admiration and, in some part of her, deep and passionate desire. This truly was unending love or, rather, unending desire.</p>

<p>But then, their seemingly romantic moment was interrupted by an announcement from the bar staff: &#8220;Ok everybody, please welcome tonight&#8217;s main event&#8212;DJ Km Dish!&#8221;</p>

<p>The DJ took the stage and proclaimed, &#8220;Ta-daa,&#8221; immediately rousing the patrons who had begun to feel sleepy with their stomachs full of Pimm&#8217;s and cheap beer. For her part, Alexi (Ivec) had managed to sample everyone&#8217;s beer but still hadn&#8217;t found one she quite liked.</p>

<p>The DJ cut in: &#8220;Are you ready to take it wayyyy back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My thirsty body is ready!&#8221; cried Courtney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ok, get ready for 2009&#8217;s United State of Pop!&#8221;</p>

<p>The entire chorale cheered, ready for a night of nostalgia. As the DJ spun up Lady Gaga&#8217;s quintessential hit, &#8220;Just Dance,&#8221; somewhere between 10 and 20 members of chorale hit the floor and began to dance wildly with the others content to watch the spectacle, although a small contingent set off to play Codenames in the corner.</p>

<p>A strapping young Welshman cut in on the dance floor, eyeing a certain Millie Lin. As he swaggered up to her, he introduced himself: &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m Lewis!&#8221;</p>

<p>Millie thought it strange that he would bring up religion in this context, but replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s cool that you&#8217;re Jewish; I&#8217;m Millie. What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the confused Welsh boy had no time to reply as the roof came off the Whetherspoon&#8217;s, and the songs of every poet resounded through Chorale&#8217;s thirsty bodies as they rose and soared through the air like seagulls.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>Delighted by their new flying capabilities, Chorale zipped around the Cambridgeshire fenlands. Minseung somersaulted through the clouds as he tried to see how far the wind would carry his belting, &#8220;Lobet Den Herrn.&#8221; Suddenly Steve realized there was someone mission from Chorale&#8217;s airborne adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buddy Check!&#8221; Steve announced.</p>

<p>Chorale glanced around, but nobody could identify the missing person. Noah, however, quietly surveyed and swiftly noticed Joss was missing&#8212;&#8220;He must be back in Ely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chorale zoomed through the air back to Ely. The group dashed through the streets looking for Joss, but he was nowhere to be found&#8212;not by Tea for Two, not by the ducks, not by James&#8217;s store. Minseung, now finished with his rendition of Back, caught up to the the rest of Chorale.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we looking for?&#8221; he asked Teresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joss,&#8221; Teresa replied, just curtly enough to convey her disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I think he&#8217;s still in the cathedral!&#8221;</p>

<p>Teresa, followed by the rest of Chorale, beelined for the cathedral. Surely enough, Joss was slumped at the base of the Octagon Tower with his luggage in hand. Shifting slightly, Joss called out to Chorale, &#8220;I can&#8217;t fly with my 49.9-pound duffle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eager to help and get their exercise in for the day, Toby, Sonja, and Miles each grabbed a handle on the bag and gracefully floated into the paneled angels&#8217; loft of the tower. But the angels were more lifelike&#8212;in fact, more alive&#8212;than Chorale had realized.</p>

<p>Astonished at the flying intruders in their tower, Ely&#8217;s Octagon Angels leapt off their panels and chased the airborne Chorale members, shooting blazing lasers from their eyes at the unwelcome visitors.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>The Chorale members weaved through the ornate Gothic interior, only narrowly avoiding the deadly assaults of their pursuers. Below the carnage scurried KimiAnn, clutching her father&#8217;s video camera, recording every single moment. In a moment of confusion Millie glanced up at Kyle as they raced through the cathedral and asked what they could do to escape the angels. Kyle&#8217;s gaze went from one of desperation to determination, and he ground to a halt to answer Millie&#8217;s plea. Not noticing the tall, sultry chemist had stopped, Theo flew head-first into him. The suitcase he was clutching erupted open from the collision, releasing of a slurry of Ariana Grande <em>Dangerous Woman</em> tour sweatshirts and empty bottles of Pinot Grigio. The contents of Theo&#8217;s suitcase assailed the Octagon Angels, and letting out a shriek they fell to the floor of the cathedral. The chorale cheered in celebration and broke into an impromptu rendition of &#8220;Shenandoah,&#8221; but before Jasmine was even able to comment on the quality of tuning, a hysterical scream was heard from Courtney: &#8220;Noooo, Sexi Lexi has been hit!&#8221;</p>

<p>Staring down towards the angel-covered floor, the members of Chorale saw the body of Alexis Rochat and at once flew down to his aid. Having noticed that Alexis Rochat was no longer breathing, the members of Chorale knew they had to act fast before it was too late.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>Teresa, devastated, frantically ran over to him and passionately performed CPR.</p>

<p>&#8220;One, two, three&#8230;&#8221; <em>exhale</em>. &#8220;One, two, three&#8230;&#8221; <em>exhale</em>.</p>

<p>Miraculously, Alexis awoke. Out of nowhere, all the Chorale members began to sing Dove&#8217;s &#8220;They Will Rise.&#8221; Some waltzed in circles around the two.</p>

<p>One day later, it was their wedding. Eric (Tuan) had composed a piece for them. It was not as good as &#8220;Unending Love.&#8221; Teresa and Alexis could not mask their disappointment. Theo, holding a drink remarked, &#8220;Oh, god.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one in the wedding knew that once Teresa and Alexis kissed again, Alexis would die. Robert performed an organ arrangement. He started out calmly, but as the piece intensified he started wailing, hysterically flailing and slamming his arms and hands on the keys. After the piece, he gathered himself and presumed to officiate the wedding. He said, &#8220;You may now kiss the bride&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>James then stood up and shouted, &#8220;I love you!&#8221; Everyone knew which one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>The yellow and purple spotted dragon stared back at him from across the pond. The other dragons looked on with jealousy, longing for the day when they, too, would find true love with such a tall and handsome lad. As if in a trance, Delaney stood from her perch at once and stepped forward. &#8220;I will officiate their wedding,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>Noah rose as well. &#8220;And I will bear the rings,&#8221; he said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Now, MILES turns to face the camera, breaking the fourth wall.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;He will try&#8230;&#8221; said Miles with a devilish grin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[MILES winks at the camera.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>James was very pleased. &#8220;Thank you all, so very much. This means the world to me,&#8221; he stressed with a tear in his eye.</p>

<p>The group made their way up to the Salisbury Cathedral spire (you know, the one that is 404 feet tall and off-center by 30 inches such that if you were to drop a plumb-line from the top, it wouldn&#8217;t go straight down) for the wedding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, set the mood,&#8221; commanded James, and Robert began the Duruflé.</p>

<p>James and the yellow and purple spotted dragon took their positions at the front in preparation for marriage, while the other dragons wailed in misery below, obsessed with their own loneliness. The rest of the chorale admired the couple, and with the sun shining warmly and low in the sky a swallow flew by overhead, singing a song of love.</p>

<p>The service was ready to begin. Robert abruptly stopped playing the Duruflé, and a peregrine falcon dove swiftly for the swallow, snapping its neck and silencing its song. Delaney stepped forward to marry James and the yellow and purple spotted dragon, and with greater elegance and eloquence than any officiant the world had ever seen before, she began, &#8220;James, want you to marry dragon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; James replied.</p>

<p>She continued, &#8220;And dragon, want you to marry James?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dragon let out a cheerful gurgle and a stream of flames that set the spire on fire. Delaney continued, &#8220;Nice! Okay, Noah, the rings please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noah leapt forward with quiet but rapt attention, and as he brandished the rings, Miles suddenly stripped to his underwear, tore out his hair, and charged toward Noah on all-fours screaming, &#8220;My precious!&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>They grappled on the precipice, trading blows as the lava lake bubbled with ominous rumbling. Delaney sprinted along the ledge, brandishing music and a thermometer as she shouted, &#8220;Away, foul fiend!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles paid no heed, grabbing at the rings held in Noah&#8217;s fingers as he climbed over the rocks, the glow of molten stone reflecting off his sweaty scalp. Delaney&#8217;s thermometer swung down with an unseemly <em>gong</em> and Miles was flung down with the rings into the fiery furnace.</p>

<p>We now journey with our intrepid protagonists back to civilization and Chorale, though not without a stop for a pint and a Sudafed. Noah and Delaney stumbled out of the lava and chorister-smoke into the incongruously sunny afternoon at Old Sarum. Noah wondered idly how the castle didn&#8217;t collapse into the volcano beneath it. As they strolled along, the ground grew dark at their feet. Delaney raised her eyes to see a vision in navy and gold: stars shone from the night sky rising from her feet, while the sun seemed to exude from her face and upraised arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the great and powerful Frances, queen of the West and Mistress of the Fiery Mount, ruler of all that can here be seen. Speak and be heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were just looking for a pint, your majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a Sudafed, if such potions be found here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some words of wisdom would be appreciated as well,&#8221; Noah murmured, lowering his eyes from the awesome sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well that&#8217;s all in order,&#8221; the royal vision replied warmly. &#8220;The pub is down this path, two rights and a left past Joss&#8217;s Fyne Wares and Missing Proprietor. Should you find the man where he&#8217;s supposed to be, Sudafed may there by purchased. For wisdom, know these: that Oscar would happily accept Amelia&#8217;s bargain, that if it weren&#8217;t for Ben, Teresa might well have hooked up at Oxford, and that the tour bible&#8217;s commandments are truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus did the great queen Frances, ruler of et cetera, bid Noah and Delaney farewell on their quest to find a pint, civilization, and Chorale.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>During the beginning of their great journey, Delaney, being the methodical thinker that she is, said to Noah, &#8220;Noah, I think the first thing we need to do is rank finding the pint, civilization, and Chorale in order of priority.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy!&#8221; Noah replied. &#8220;In the very order you said it: let&#8217;s find a good pint, then some civilization, and maybe after that look for the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Delaney could retort, the ground began to shake and a thunderous rumbling filled the sky, along with the blaring music of Marice Duruflé&#8217;s &#8220;Libera Me&#8221; (a selection from Chorale&#8217;s soon-to-be Grammy-nominated album). Suddenly, an apparition appeared right in front of their eyes. It was a ghost!</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the first ghost that will help you in your quest!&#8221; she exclaimed in a booming, <em>tenor</em> voice.</p>

<p>Noah and Delaney responded, &#8220;Teresa, is it really you!?&#8221;</p>

<p>She responded, &#8220;Yes, it is me, and I have come to deliver you the first thing you seek.&#8221; The Ghost of Teresa passed them a pint and bellowed, &#8220;Mandatory fun!!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Noah, relieved to have the pint but shocked and saddened by this twist, asked, &#8220;Teresa, how did you die?&#8221;</p>

<p>She replied, &#8220;Too much mandatory fun. I was telling everyone about my dramatic romantic liaisons with various Chorale men, and then I just expired.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ghost of Teresa vanished. &#8220;Libera Me&#8221; continued to boom on in the background. Then, another apparition appeared!</p>

<p>This ghost exclaimed, &#8220;I have come to help you with the second part of your quest&#8212;finding civilization!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney and Noah looked at each other in horror&#8212;&#8220;Julia!? You too!?&#8221; they exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me!&#8221; she said. &quot;I know the way to a cute bookstore I found while exploring.</p>

<p>While they walked, Delaney asked, &#8220;But Julia, how did <em>you</em> die?&#8221;</p>

<p>She responded, &#8220;While I was exploring, I saw a cute baby, ate it, and died from indigestion.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they arrived at the bookstore at the corner of town, the Ghost of Julia vanished. Then, of course, the third Chorale ghost appeared. At the sight of him, Noah and Delaney fell down to their knees and bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Sano!&#8221; they cried. &#8220;Please help us find our beloved Chorale fellows!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ghost of Steve snapped his fingers and KimiAnn appeared at his side. He said, &#8220;I know just the way to get back to the chorale, Noah and Delaney! Thanks for your EM. It&#8217;s going to require some special magic though. KimiAnn, are you recording this?&#8221;</p>

<p>And at that moment, Steve began to chant a spell, with lots of messa di voces, that would get the lost Delaney and Noah back to the chorale. But the spell didn&#8217;t work without complications&#8230;</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>Amelia, trying to watch what Steve was saying while he was conducting, realized she did not remember the spell. Was it <em>lorax</em> or <em>zarex</em>? It couldn&#8217;t be&#8230; <em>zanex</em>? Because <em>lorax</em> had the beloved <em>O</em> vowel, she decided to join in on a B. Although her tone was superb, Jasmine&#8217;s slanting expression hinted (or, rather, let her know) that she had mispronounced the spell. All of a sudden, a bottle of Clorox appeared! Disapprovingly, Steve did his slight down-head-tilt-and-smile to show his disapproval. All was lost. Delaney and Noah would remain forever lost to the Chorale.</p>

<p>In order to cheer everyone up, Ben decided to buy everyone drinks and brought his pet seagull to rehearsal. However, Steve preferred that the seagull stand behind Alexis (in Delaney&#8217;s place), so he again moved Teresa to the end of the row.</p>

<p><em>This is perfect</em>, she thought, <em>Now, I can tell more people about Alexis Rochat and I!</em></p>

<p>And thus, instead of singing her part, she would write notes in her music and pass them to audience members. These messages included, &#8220;They will rise, but can you save me from this flying seagull?&#8221; and &#8220;I have listened to &#8216;Shenandoah&#8217; 672 times today.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Frances continued her evil plot with taking over America. She had managed to gain the Americans&#8217; trust by dressing like their Lady Liberty and decided the only thing that could be done would be to continue her quest with singing every single voice part in the chorale. As soon as she got placed as a Dec. soprano, she realized she could be any part she wanted (because no one ever gets moved to soprano).</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>As Courtney&#8217;s power grew, she adopted a new name, taking on her identity as the Pitch Shift Bish. Her powers were activated by a simple back crack, from which a powerful &#8220;HWAHHH&#8221; emerged, shifting not only her voice part, but all the voice parts of the people around her. Imagine Steve&#8217;s panic upon realizing that Lorin&#8217;s sweet alto tones had been replaced with low notes to rival James&#8217;s while Eric was suddenly screeching high Cs with relative ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever shall we do?&#8221; he cried, &#8220;Our voices are all out of wack!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, a beam of light to rival Stephen Cleobury&#8217;s appeared and cough drops began raining from the sky. In through the window of the cathedral floated Amy, the glorious carrier of the Bag of Life, who landed gracefully in front of a panic-stricken Chorale.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have Benadryl for days and Advil for anyone,&#8221; she sang in a cough-syrupy sweet voice! &#8220;But don&#8217;t you <em>dare</em> ask me for DayQuil or NyQuil,&#8221; she sternly added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; Anna begged in her new tenor tones. &#8220;Return our voices to us with your magically life-giving bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; Amy thought for a while. &#8220;I have nothing in this magical bag that can match the power of Courtney the Pitch Shift Bish. However, I know of a place where such magic could potentially be found.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only Robert the mystical organ keeper could return Chorale&#8217;s original voices.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>There was some good and bad news associated with this. The good news was that Robert knew exactly how to return Chorale&#8217;s original voices; all that was required were the last seven chords of the Vaughan Williams, followed by, &#8220;Yes, Bravo!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bad news was that Chorale wasn&#8217;t quite in agreement that Chorale <em>should</em> switch back to their original voices. Even though Jasmine was quite upset with her new alto voice, many of the altos were quite pleased by their new soprano voices. For example, Lorin was loving the fact that she would get to perform the soprano solos, and Lauren was kind of relieved that she wouldn&#8217;t be responsible for any more high notes in the Gibbs. And both the altos and tenors agreed that it was time for them to get to have some fun in the O&#8217;Regan.</p>

<p>The argument raged on and on all through the night and eventually Alexis Ivec decided that something had to be done about it. She then went to the partially disassembled organ at Salisbury and prayed to it, saying, &#8220;It must suck to be all split up, and I can&#8217;t bear the thought of the same thing happening to Chorale, so could you please restore the Chorale&#8217;s original voices?&#8221;</p>

<p>The organ did nothing because organs are not sentient.</p>

<p>In the end, Robert ended up filling in as an organist for a different choir, and everything that needed to happen happened, and Chorale was back to normal. Unfortunately, all of thee basses and tenors were now gone because&#8230;</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>&#8230;in a sudden turn of events, Steve decided to return to his roots as a Palo Alto boy treble by eliminating the lower voices. Disheartened, the basses and tenors decided to form their own counter group, a group dedicated to singing only Duruflé. Meanwhile, Steve&#8217;s new &#8220;boy treble&#8221; choir consisting of only women was putting together a concert featuring the mountain song by Herndon.</p>

<p>On the day of the concert, as the choir began to perform, there was an air of unease. Right as Steve began his speech about the connection of Eric Tuan to Stanford and Chorale, the new male choir, now named Minseung &amp; the Bimbettes, stormed the cathedral! They began an impromptu performance of &#8220;Tota Pulchra Est&#8221; by Duruflé down the octave (though Tobin sang it in the original octave). Thus began a Chorale battle between Steve&#8217;s all-female boy treble choir and Minseung &amp; the Bimbettes. Both sides fought valiantly, with the women performing an SSAA arrangement of &#8220;Unending Love,&#8221; and the males retorting with a SSA trio solo featuring Tobin, Alexis, and Minseung.</p>

<p>But once the dust settled, both groups realized that perhaps Chamber Chorale was better as a mixed choir. Thus the two groups recombined, and a new era of Chamber Chorale began. The four sections lived in harmony until, one day, the tenor section attacked. Only Eric Tuan, master of all four sections could save us. But unfortunately, he was preoccupied leading Piedmont Children&#8217;s Choir, so they were left searching for someone to reunite all the sections. Suddenly, a collective idea came to mind, and they all realized there was only one person they could turn to for help&#8230;</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>&#8230;Helen. They needed one of her fun facts about the church they were near in order to help them understand the true meaning of their quest. Upon heading this Minseung realized what had to be done. They needed to sacrifice a member of Chorale to the Sea Gods so they could truly be an ocean. Amy suggested Joss at first, but he was late so they decided to sacrifice Courtney instead of waiting for him to show up, because who knows how long that would take. Now, one would think Courtney would be upset by the fact she was being scarified but once she was told that it would be worth ten Chorale points, she happily obliged.</p>

<p>They prepared the ritual, raising their hands in the shape of a triangle above their heads and emulating the ocean&#8217;s sounds. However, upon completion nothing seemed to happen. Steve assumed it had not worked because Jasmine was not there to give a solo, but the real reason was because they had not given Courtney the correct burial upon her sacrifice. They needed ten boy trebles to be buried with her so she could die happy. Julia was able to provide seven, since she had kidnapped them from Salisbury, but they needed three more. Oscar knew exactly where to find some because, little did they know, he was actually two boy trebles stacked on top of each other, posing as a frat boy. So, Oscar told Chorale where the land of boy trebles was, but Kyle interjected with a fact about map-reading and told them they were wrong to follow Oscar. Instead of putting up with his shit any more, they left him behind with Helen so they could spew fun facts to each other for eternity.</p>

<p>So, having left Kyle behind, Chorale set out on their journey, dragging Courtney&#8217;s dead body along with them when suddenly&#8230;</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>&#8230;the elders of Chorale called the tribe together for an emergency vote: what was to be done about the Catastrophe that had caused Courtney&#8217;s death? How would they ever recover?</p>

<p>The eldest leader Minseung was vying for control with the recent upstart Anna who, together with her brother Theo, was in the midst of executing a coup. Chorale had divided into factions: those supporting Minseung&#8217;s plan to escape the monster by packing up and moving to Wales, and those supporting Anna&#8217;s idea to use the magical protection of the Avebury Henge in the battle. After a heated discussion, the deciding vote was cast by Amy, who believed that they should use the joint powers of all four sections to conquer the monster of sleep deprivation. As night came, the Chorale kept singing spells to keep the monster at bay. But one by one, the members began to drop out and fall asleep. With each one, the monster became more sure of his victory. But he had underestimated the magical powers of one member of the choir. From her perch on one of the great stones, Millie began the finest, most rousing speech anyone had ever witnessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may not be the loudest singer the choir has. I may not know the most spells. In high school, I couldn&#8217;t even pronounce <em>wingardium leviosa</em>. But I know the secret to defeating the monster. I must sacrifice myself for the good of the choir.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Millie let herself fall asleep willingly, and the monster screamed his last and died. Anna and Theo declared themselves victorious and began to plan a great celebration of their victory and mourning for their losses.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>Of course, with every celebration and mourning, you need a great planner as well as a stellar event organizer. As the #1 social chair in our hearts, Millie planned a great bonfire ceremony held amid the ruins of Avebury.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall sacrifice KimiAnn in a mighty celebration of our victories,&#8221; Millie stated, &#8220;while Robert shall repeat the first two bars of Dove and chant in Welsh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Lord yes,&#8221; Robert said.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, only Helen showed up to the event; the rest of Chorale went off to get drinks instead after Millie sent out the itinerary. &#8220;My tour company did not pay me enough for this,&#8221; Helen shouted as she stormed off.</p>

<p>Thus, KimiAnn was spared from her certain fate, and she proceeded to join Chorale at the bar and get slammed in celebration. Millie had other plans for KimiAnn, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fallen souls still require a sacrifice on their behalf for appeasement of their untimely demise; surely the royal heir of the Sano family line&#8212;a bloodline that traces a glorified heritage of a boy treble at the vaunted halls of Palo Alto, California&#8212;as a sacrifice would be the only acceptable offering to our Holy Matron, Jasmine. Only through an acceptable offering could I even dream of having her follow me back on Instagram,&#8221; Millie mulled.</p>

<p>Robert quickly interjected, &#8220;But how do we know that our Holy Matron Jasmine is real? I mean, if I can only hear other soprano voices for solos now, does she even exist anymore? I would describe myself as an atheist-turned-cheerful agnostic&#8212;I find the idea of perfect pitch cheerful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s fine; whatever you think&#8212;will you help me perform the required sacrifice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just give me about an hour of absolute silence with the organ, and you will be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Millie once again returned to Avebury, having heard its monumental significance and rich history dating from the Neolithic era. Much to her chagrin, however, there was absolutely nothing of interest at the site except, perhaps, some sheep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the fuck did we not go to Stonehenge?&#8221; she exclaimed as she climbed on top of one of the rocks to assert her dominance over Steve. Dismayed, she dusted herself off to the land of the sheep-shaggers&#8212;Wales&#8212;and into Tintern Abbey.</p>

<p>Now, she found some more useless rocks, but she had gotten wind of rumors that a secret distillery&#8217;s operations had been going on in these Abbeys. Seizing her favorite drinking buddy, Amelia, by arm, Millie stormed into Tintern Abbey with a loud demand: &#8220;HEAR YE, ALL YE PEASANT MONKS! GUIDE ME TO YOUR NEAREST SOURCE OF THE FABLED ALKERHOL!&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>As the gate smashed open, the monks gathered about.</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly cannot!&#8221; Monk Eric yelled back. &#8220;The sacred alkerhol must not be touched. You shall not be led into temptation. Ay-men!&#8221;</p>

<p>Millie was a bit taken aback but was quick to think on her feet. A moment after seeing Monk Eric&#8217;s face, she knew exactly what to do. She pulled up her phone and found a photo of Rosie, Eric&#8217;s long-lost lover, on Facebook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her&#8230; I need to get out of here!&#8221; said no-longer-a-monk and very tempted Eric, who ran off to America and found his lover with whom he married some four months after.</p>

<p>Monk KimiAnn, who had not dared to touch the fabled alkerhol, was intrigued by the commotion. &#8220;I will guide you to the alkerhol if you&#8217;ll take me bar hopping with you,&#8221; Monk KimiAnn said, no longer wishing to live a repressed life of Tintern Abbey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so easily!&#8221; a soft yet authoritative voice rang through the walls of the abbey. It was the voice of Head-monk Sonja, who worked all her life to protect the sanctity of the abbey and the alkerhol, carefully crafted to worship our lord god Stephen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who shall <em>ascend</em> into the hill of the Lord or who shall rise up in his holy place? Not he who approaches the alkerhol with an unclean heart, nor he who hath sworn to deceive his neighbor. Thou hath defiled the abbey of our Stephen, and thou shalt be thrown down into the Abyss. Laurens!&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon this call, two figures appeared, garbed in black hoods. One yielded a scythe and the other was equipped with a scathing sass. They advanced towards the group in step with one another, a skill they surely had perfected over the course of hundreds of Evensongs. Behind the group more hooded figures closed in, encircling them.</p>

<p>The first Lauren said, &#8220;They used to make me do this with a mace, but I&#8217;m so glad they let me switch to a scythe. It&#8217;s by far my favorite of all my weapons.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pulled back the scythe in preparation to decapitate her first victim, but there was a flash in the chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay you guys, now try to squeeze together so we all fit in the picture!&#8221;</p>

<p>Linda had come to the rescue! With the monks disoriented and dismayed, the group swiped the alkerhol and fled the abbey.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>Once they were safely outside the walls, they paused to regroup. After two inconclusive buddy checks (Sonja had earlier wisely pointed out the flaw in the buddy system&#8212;what if <em>both</em> buddies were missing?), Steve and Helen each counted the group three times, and they were ready to go. Well, just as soon as Steve made a quick Facebook post to update the chorale&#8217;s many fans on the group&#8217;s narrow escape from the abbey, complete with photos. Steve lamented that there was no time to photoshop out the monks in the background who were ruining the lovely view of the abbey behind the frantically sprinting Chorale members.</p>

<p>Chorale now faced an existential choice: keep running or give up and make a new home for themselves in the woods. After a tense discussion, Steve reminded them that Chorale was a dictatorship and informed them that they would be staying put. And thus, Chorale-ville was born. They quickly divided up the labor: Oscar and Julia wrote out the social contract and philosophical underpinnings of the new society, Kyle used his chem skills to build a still, Amy started their central bank and began issuing currency (Stevecoin), Lauren created some weapons for hunting, Joss composed the national anthem, and Alexis began sewing subfuscs from robes they had stolen from the monks. Just when their new society finally reached stability, and Chorale began to breathe easily again, Alexis Ivec burst into the town square with news&#8212;the monks had returned!</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>But this time, they had dragons&#8212;big, red, Welsh, fire-breathing dragons. There was only one thing for it. Since they were, luckily, in Avebury, Chorale made a beeline for the biggest, craggiest, most mysterious-looking stone. Naturally forming themselves into a loose circle around it, instinctually (but casually) facing different directions, Chorale broke into a dance, choreographed by Julia. They picked up speed as they circled, until in all the excitement Toby began to climb the monolith like a young mountain goat, gaining the top and throwing his arms in the air as his friends danced and chanted below him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my lord!&#8221; exclaimed Robert from somewhere just beyond the circle, &#8220;do they not know how dangerous such behavior is in Wales!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, Ben&#8217;s smile began to grow brighter and wider, until first it obliterated Ben&#8217;s face, and then the Chorale members dancing near him, and then the entire circle of dancers, stone and all. In one blinding, smiling flash, all the world disappeared, and the dancing, singing, chanting chorale fell to the ground in a heap.</p>

<p>Sonja was the first to wake up with a gasp. &#8220;It worked!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;We moved ourselves to a different timeline! But where are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a sign over here,&#8221; replied Amelia. She moved closer to read it. &#8220;It just says, &#8216;Chepstow Castle.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>They woke up one by one, each getting up and admiring the large post-Roman stone fortification. (Joss, of course, was the last to wake up). Miles and Julia, who were prancing around the castle, came running back to the group, shouting, &#8220;We&#8217;re stuck inside!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were right. They couldn&#8217;t open any of the doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; Alexis Ivec muttered, &#8220;I was planning on going on a run!&#8221;</p>

<p>People began trying to find their way out. Toby started climbing the walls. Lauren Ramlan went on a search for swords or knives to help cut through chains and locks.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, everyone heard a booming voice. At first it sounded like the voice of God, but soon everyone recognized it as Helen&#8217;s voice over the speakerphone, somehow projecting its way all the way into the castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ta-da! Welcome to Chepstow Castle,&#8221; Helen began, &quot;Because of the detour, the only way we could get you all into the Castle on time was&#8230; magic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, the only way to get you out of it is also magic. In order to get everyone safely on the bus, I will need you all to tell me three things I taught you about Chepstow Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone looked at each other in panic (except Theo, who had a face of disgust).</p>

<p>Anna whispered to Amy, &#8220;I always listen to music on the bus when Helen talks. Did she even mention Chepstow Castle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Luckily, Noah and Eric came to the rescue. They always sat at the front of the bus and paid great attention during announcements. They shouted out three facts they remembered. Everyone cheered. Chorale was teleported from Chepstow Castle back onto the bus with Helen, and they were making their way to Cardiff when, all of a sudden&#8230;</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>&#8230;the bus began to shake! Everyone woke up from their naps and looked around in panic&#8212;an Earthquake! In England!?</p>

<p>As cars veered in panic, Chris&#8217;s expert driving skills helped keep the bus on track as it speeded down the motorway. Chorale held on for dear life as Theo slept through everything. Finally the earth went still and a sigh of relief went out, to which Eric shouted a loud <em>AY-MEN</em>. Happy to still be alive and well, the bus continued its journey into Cardiff.</p>

<p>Upon disembarking from the bus on this sunny afternoon, Chorale found themselves accosted by a loud Welsh bachelor party. A fat man adorning a wedding dress pointed and shouted, &#8220;It&#8217;s the bloody Americans!&#8221;</p>

<p>The party of drunk men charged at Chorale, and the members scattered in alarm. After a bit of a few kicks up the backside and an exchange of insults the drunken Welshmen sauntered away. Steve did a quick headcount, but there was one missing! Who could it be? Everyone looked for Joss, the obvious culprit, but he was present. Then it dawned upon everyone: it was Toby. The chorale looked around and shouted his name, but still no sign. Chorale was wondering how they could find Toby, when someone said&#8230;</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s listen for the sound of someone singing Hamilton songs!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lorin Philips jumped onto this idea, as she often joined in with Toby&#8217;s murmured rapping of memorized Hamilton pieces. She knew she&#8217;d be able to pick out the soundtrack from a mile away.</p>

<p>But Alexis Ivec shot down this idea. She knew she&#8217;d be able to find Toby the fasted by looking for someone moving with the grave of a social dancer. As his dance parter, Alexis knew she could climb to the highest point of the Cardiff Castle and be able to spot Toby in any direction by his movements.</p>

<p>Amelia and Delaney had another idea. Since they knew the two of them plus Toby were three of the best-dressed people in Chorale, they decided they would look for Toby by singling out the best-dressed people in the city. After having been in Cardiff for a day already, they knew the fashion sense of the majority of the population was abysmal. They had already counted twelve skinny and hairy men walking around with their shirts off. Brits really don&#8217;t know how to handle a heat wave&#8230; So Delaney and Amelia followed Alexis to the top of the Castle to look for Toby and his snazzy clothing.</p>

<p>The rest of Chorale broke up into teams to search the streets the old fashioned way. Everyone agreed that Frances, Noah (a.k.a. Rookie of the Year and Attendance Extraordinaire), and Helen were the three most responsible members of the group, so they became the search party leaders.</p>

<p>With Chorale spread out over the entire city, Lauren Ramlan came up with the great idea for everyone to start singing Toby&#8217;s favorite Chorale piece: Tuan&#8217;s &#8220;Unending Love.&#8221; Wherever Toby was in the city, he would be able to hear his favorite song and follow the sound of the angelic voices to rejoin the group. Lauren Ramlan sent a message to the Slack about her plan to make sure everyone starting singing at the same time. Suddenly, someone replied to her message&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuan&#8217;s &#8216;Unending Love&#8217;!? My favorite!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Toby! Apparently the only notifications that were turned on on his phone were for Slack, but no one thought to actually <strong>@toby</strong>. Once Toby rejoined the group at the hotel, Chorale set off for their last concert of U.K. tour.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>Chorale loaded onto the coach, and Linda noted to Steve that she thought Chris looked a little off this afternoon. Was he just tired from our detour yesterday, or could something else be up? As we started driving away, suddenly Chris started accelerating into oncoming traffic. Out of nowhere, the coach sprouted wings and took off like an airplane, nearly avoiding a collision with an oncoming double-decker bus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck getting to your concert now,&#8221; Chris cackled to himself, clearly annoyed by all the backstreet driving Chorale was having him do. &#8220;I&#8217;m taking you straight to Heathrow tonight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately, Helen was ultra-prepared and had parachutes packed away under her bus seat. She distributed one to everyone and said, &#8220;On my count, we jump! One&#8230; two&#8230; jump!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone leaped from the bus, but unfortunately Miles&#8217;s parachute didn&#8217;t open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miles!&#8221; exclaimed Amelia and James!</p>

<p>James had the brilliant idea to use his deep voice to call to Robert who was awaiting their arrival outside the Cathedral.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look up,&#8221; James called, and Robert deftly ran under Miles and caught him, saving the day in more ways beyond playing the organ.</p>

<p>Now safely at the cathedral for their concert, Chorale rehearsed and went downstairs for a lovely dinner prepared for us by the ladies of the cathedral. Little did they know, the food all contained a special ingredient that caused everyone&#8217;s voices to drop exactly a perfect fifth. No problem&#8212;Jasmine wasn&#8217;t there, so no one should be bothered if they sang the entire concert down a fifth. Unfortunately for Robert the organ was an antique, so he had to transpose everything on the spot rather than use a fancy transpose button. It all sounded great, and the audience gave Chorale a standing ovation.</p>

<p>In the back&#8212;is that a bird? a plane? It&#8217;s a dove! Jonathan Dove! He came up to Steve and told him how much he loved his piece, especially lower. Since Chorale had lost their coach, he arranged a flock of doves to fly us back to the hotel. With Miles, Delaney, and Amy in the lead (since it was their last concert), they flew off into the setting sun, ending the tour for this year.</p>
